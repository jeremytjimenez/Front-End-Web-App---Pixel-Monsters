# Very Calm Death Battle

A simple game where two monsters are randomly generated over a randomly generated background and you choose their actions. 

Just download the folder, open index.html in a browser and play. Write a name for your characters and then click create. Then you can choose their actions and have them attack, defend or evade. Once one (or both of them) dies, you can click the "again?" to create a new set of characters and do it all over again.

Happy battles!
